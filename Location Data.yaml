# Data Structure:
#   The LOCATIONS dictionary contains keys of each location's reference number (0, 7, 5a, 10b)
#   Those keys contain all the data about a location. Each location must have:
#       Name -- not sure this will be used in the game anyways...but I just put it there.
#       References: which the player can call a location by.
#       Visited: times the player visited that location
#       NARRATIVES: Dictionary of narratives, in which there is a long and (not always) short one. If no short, default to long narrative.
#         Both the long and the short are able to have general narratives to use in general cases, and exceptions. If a location has one set
#         narrative set regardless of the state of anything else in the game, then the narratives are simply declared with the 'long' and 'short' keys.
#         If there are exceptions, however, then underneath the 'long' and 'short' keys will be 'general' and 'exception' keys. The general will just
#         contain the 
#       Moves: Going north takes you to location 5, going west takes you to location 8
#         Certain directions can also take you to a 'block' which is an active block: you can't go somewhere because of a certain requirement,
#         or a 'nowhere': which means you have simply reached the boundary of a specific room or of the map of the game or something.
#     Can have:
#       Conditions: Narratives that should be played based on either:
#         1. A location’s state
#         2. A player’s state
#         3. An object’s state
#         The state categories are lists within the conditions dictionary, and the actual states are
#         lists within the state category lists.
#         There will be a corresponding narrative for each state specified within the long or        
#         short sections of NARRATIVES, the narrative will be contained within a dictionary of key
#         corresponding to the state name.
#      State Changes:
intro: You open your eyes and are blinded by the ray of light coming from above.
      You look up, and see trees all around you. Realizing that you are inside the
      trunk of one of these trees, you try to stand up, but your legs are too weak.
      Crawling out of the trunk, you hear rushing water, and see that to your right,
      or east, is the edge of a cliff.

warnings:
  boundaries:
    - Out of bounds, this location takes you nowhere.
    - You sure you want to fall off the game? Well, you can't. Going this direction takes you nowhere;
      you have hit a game boundary.
    - One step further and you fall off the face of the flat earth; going this direction 
      takes you nowhere. You have hit a game boundary.
