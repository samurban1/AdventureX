        # This is different than most state_change dictionaries, since health is not a boolean, but rather
        # a mutable number. There is a general reaction in case the exceptions don't pass, and I use the 
        # general/exceptions system in a backwards way -- I use it on itself, in the sense that inside the
        # health state_changes dictionary I check if the health is in a certain range, and if so, play the 
        # provided reaction.
        general: Your health has decreased, be warned.
